## BAC Calculation

The app uses the **Widmark formula** to calculate blood alcohol content:

```
BAC = (Alcohol in grams / (Body weight in grams √ó Distribution factor)) √ó 100
```

- **Distribution factors**: Male (0.68), Female (0.55), Other (0.61, but hiddden in UI)
- **Alcohol metabolism**: Subtracts 0.015% per hour since first drink
- **Real-time updates**: BAC changes as you add drinks and time passes

## Getting Started

1. Open `HolesoviceTracker.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Select your target device or simulator
3. Build and run the app
4. Tap the **Me** button to set up your profile
5. Start tracking your drinks!

## Usage

1. **Set up your profile** by tapping the "Me" button and entering your details
2. **Switch between tabs** to track alcohol or caffeine
3. **Tap the + button** to add a new drink
4. **Fill in the details** (name, amount, alcohol % or caffeine content)
5. **View your progress** in the activity ring and BAC display
6. **Check history** to see all your entries
7. **Use edit mode** to delete entries you want to remove

The app automatically calculates standard drinks for alcohol, tracks total caffeine consumption, and provides real-time BAC estimates based on your personal data, helping you stay within recommended daily limits and make informed decisions about your consumption.
